    <h2>How did it started?</h2>
    <p>For quite some time I have a fascination with esoteric programming languages.
      Even When I started university after gaining a little confidence in my programming skills,
      I wrote a first brainfuck interpreter in Python.</p>
    <p>It was terrible, slow and unoptimized, but it's source code was quite small and it was working! A little by little I improved
      it to run a specific program for displaying the Mandelbrot set. And after a while it was good enough
      to exist, but maybe not good enough to bring satisfaction with result.</p>
    <!-- TODO: Add image of that Mandelbrot set! -->
    <p>To be quite frank, I don't think that in couple first versions there was
      any intermediate representation and operation of flow control was realized by simple search.</p>
    <h2>A little about Brainfuck itself</h2>
    <p><b>Brainfuck</b> is a extremely minimalistic esoteric language that's fully <b>Turing-complete</b>.
      There's no practical use for it, but I guess a little challenges that's it brings is
      what people like me can really appreciate. Also it's probably the most famous one from many and many others.</p>
    <p>It consists from <b>only 8</b> characters: <span class="Code">+ - < > [ ] , .</span>
      four for memory access, two for flow control and the last to for input and output.
      Even with such small amount of operations it still quite good!
      But no possibility for creating something like functions is a real pain when you try to create even simple program.</p>
