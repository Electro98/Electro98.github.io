# My own little site
## Why?
I guess why not? I need a way to present my projects maybe not as display of my skill but display of my passion!
Because I really love programming and want to create beautiful things or at least fun ones.
### Ideas for projects to describe/present
 - Realization of RSA algorithm
 - Ant algorithm and journey of suffering and success (with quick mention of other projects during that course?)
 - Parser for a friend
 - My chess engine (and hopefully full chess game)
 - Show in terminal!
 - Image to terminal
 - ? - Live wallpapers
 - BF Porth (only if I review it after a while)
 - Minecraft model-statue by 3d projectors
